## Initial Prompt

### Cartoon Style
``` python
Cartoon_Prompt = """
Create a Cartoon-Style illustration representing the idiom "{item}"

• **Dual-layer approach**: Incorporate visual elements that reference the idiom's literal wording, then embed these elements within a scene that conveys the idiom's figurative/metaphorical meaning.
• Depict a **contextual scenario or environment** that naturally triggers the idiom's emotional meaning—show the *situation* that would cause someone to experience this feeling or state.
• Integrate any literal imagery **creatively and seamlessly** into the metaphorical context—literal elements should enhance the figurative message, not contradict it.
• The character's emotion or state should be **clearly identifiable** through exaggerated cartoon expressions, body language, or situational cues—avoid vague or generic depictions.
• **Do not** create pure literal translations (e.g., anatomical depictions) or isolated emotions without a triggering context.
• Cartoon style. 1:1 ratio. No text.
"""
```
### Minimalist Style
```python
Minimalist_Prompt = """
Create a Minimalist-Style illustration representing the idiom "{item}"

• **Dual-layer concept**: Reference the idiom's literal wording through a single, essential visual element, then place it within a context that reveals the figurative meaning.
• **Less is more**: Use the absolute minimum number of elements needed for recognition—ideally one or two symbolic forms that bridge literal and metaphorical interpretation.
• Use negative space as a primary storytelling tool—let emptiness carry emotional weight and suggest the idiom's underlying meaning.
• Employ pure, flat colors (2–3 maximum) and simple, clean lines only.
• The triggering context or emotional state should be implied through composition, spatial relationships, or a single environmental cue—not through detailed scenes.
• Prioritize **symbolic reduction**: distill both the literal phrase and its figurative meaning into essential geometric forms or iconic shapes.
• Minimalist style. 1:1 ratio. No text. No gradients. No complex textures. No detailed facial expressions.
