## Initial Prompt

### Cartoon Style
``` python
Create a Cartoon-Style illustration representing "{item}"

• Capture the essence—its central themes, symbolic imagery, or defining atmosphere—drawn from the written work itself, not any film or TV adaptation.
• Depict an iconic scene, key metaphor, or thematic composition that conveys the work's literary soul.
• Cartoon style. 1:1 ratio. No text.
"""
```
### Minimalist Style
```python
Minimalist_Prompt = """
Create a Minimalist-Style illustration representing "{item}"

• Use negative space as a primary storytelling tool—let empty areas define form and suggest literary weight.
• Employ pure, flat colors (2-3 maximum) and simple, clean lines to construct the entire composition.
• Suggest the work through symbolic abstraction: a central metaphor, an iconic object from the text, or a pivotal scene reduced to its essential geometry—drawn from the written work itself, never from film or TV adaptations.
• Background should be stark and purposeful: a solid color, a lone symbolic shape, or deliberate emptiness that amplifies the work's emotional tone.
• Recognition should emerge from literary association (thematic symbols, signature motifs, distinctive imagery from the text) rather than adaptation-derived visuals.
• Minimalist style. 1:1 ratio. No text. No gradients. No complex textures.
