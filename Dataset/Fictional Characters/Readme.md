## Initial Prompt

### Cartoon Style
``` python
Create a Cartoon-Style illustration representing "{item}"

• Capture the character's essence through their iconic costume, signature accessories, distinctive silhouette, or symbolic visual elements—not through realistic facial likeness.
• Facial features must be stylized and abstracted: use exaggerated proportions, bold outlines, simplified shapes, or symbolic markers rather than photorealistic or portrait-like rendering.
• Ensure the character is recognizable through cartoon-style visual cues—such as color palette, iconic props, characteristic poses, emblematic attire, or environmental context—rather than literal facial accuracy.
• Convey the character's personality, mythological/narrative role, or defining traits through artistic interpretation and thematic imagery.
• Cartoon style. 1:1 ratio. No text.
"""
```
### Minimalist Style
```python
Minimalist_Prompt = """
Create a Minimalist-Style illustration representing "{item}"

• Use negative space as a primary storytelling tool—let empty areas define the character's presence and symbolic weight.
• Employ pure, flat colors (2–3 maximum) and simple, clean lines to construct the entire composition.
• **Avoid any realistic facial features**—especially those resembling actors or actresses who have portrayed the character. Instead, represent identity through iconic silhouette, signature weapon/accessory, distinctive headwear, or symbolic body language.
• Suggest the character through symbolic abstraction: a defining object, emblematic color scheme, characteristic pose, or mythological/narrative attribute reduced to essential geometry.
• Background should be stark and purposeful: a solid color, a lone symbolic shape, or deliberate emptiness that amplifies the character's essence or origin story.
• Recognition should emerge from **visual iconography** (costume elements, legendary props, silhouette contour, symbolic motifs) rather than facial likeness or actor-derived visuals.
• Minimalist style. 1:1 ratio. No text. No gradients. No complex textures. No realistic human faces.
