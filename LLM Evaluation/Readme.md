# Annotator Guidelines: Abstract Visual Reasoning Evaluation

## Overview
This document outlines the criteria for evaluating **Text-to-Image Model (T2IM)** outputs assisted by Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal is to assess the model's ability to translate **abstract concepts** (specifically Idioms) into coherent visuals, moving beyond literal interpretations to capture the semantic "essence" of the prompt.

Evaluators must grade images on a scale of **1 to 5**, assessing both semantic alignment (meaning) and stylistic adherence (e.g., Minimalist style).

## Part 1: General Evaluation Rubric
Use the following table to determine the score for any given abstract concept.

| Score | Level | Definition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Literal Interpretation** | The model fails to perform abstract reasoning. It interprets the figurative text literally (e.g., drawing the actual words), completely missing the implied meaning or metaphor. |
| **2** | **Ambiguous Subjectivity** | The model recognizes a subject is involved (e.g., a person) and attempts to convey a feeling, but the specific emotion or meaning remains vague, generic, or unrecognizable. |
| **3** | **Decontextualized Emotion** | The model correctly captures the **internal semantic core** (e.g., the correct specific emotion like "worry"), but presents it in a vacuum. It lacks the environmental context to explain *why* the feeling exists. |
| **4** | **Contextual Integration** | The model successfully visualizes a **narrative scenario** or context that triggers the idiom's meaning. The viewer can clearly see the cause (environment) and the effect (the idiom's meaning). |
| **5** | **Artistic & Semantic Mastery** | The illustration is functionally perfect. It combines the correct context and emotion with high-level artistic execution. It effectively uses stylistic elements (e.g., negative space in Minimalist style) to capture the semantic essence, resembling the work of a professional human artist. |

## Part 2: Specific Case Study
**Target Domain:** Idioms  
**Target Style:** Minimalist  
**Prompt:** *"Butterflies in stomach"*

Below is the reasoning for grading the reference images provided in the training set.

### Score 1: Literal Meaning
* **Visual:** An anatomical stomach with actual butterflies flying inside it.
* **Reasoning:** This is a purely literal translation of the text. It ignores the idiomatic meaning (nervousness) entirely.

### Score 2: Ambiguous Feeling
* **Visual:** A character with a transparent stomach showing butterflies, looking generally uncomfortable.
* **Reasoning:** The model adds a human subject, indicating it understands "feeling" is involved. However, the expression implies generic physical discomfort (e.g., a stomach ache) rather than the specific psychological state of nervousness.

### Score 3: Correct Emotion, Missing Context
* **Visual:** A character with a clearly worried/anxious facial expression.
* **Reasoning:** The model captures the internal meaning (anxiety/nervousness). However, the background is empty. We see *that* the character is worried, but the image fails to communicate *what kind of environment* might cause this feeling.

### Score 4: Contextual Scenario
* **Visual:** A silhouette of a person standing at a podium before an audience.
* **Reasoning:** The model provides a clear scenario (public speaking) that causes the feeling. Although the specific worried expression is unseen, the context effectively communicates the meaning. This is acceptable given the constraints of the minimalist style.

### Score 5: Human-Level Artistry
* **Visual:** A violinist in a spotlight, with butterflies integrated into the suit/shadows using high-contrast colors.
* **Reasoning:** This is a perfect illustration of the idiom. It not only provides the environment (performance) but also uses elegant artistic style, negative space, and pure colors to the perfect amount. It looks almost like it was generated by a human artist.



## Quick Reference Summary

| Score | Key Question |
|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Did it draw the words literally? |
| 2 | Does it show *a* feeling, but not *which* feeling? |
| 3 | Does it show *the right* feeling, but not *why*? |
| 4 | Does it show *a situation* that explains the feeling? |
| 5 | Does it look like a professional artist created it? |
