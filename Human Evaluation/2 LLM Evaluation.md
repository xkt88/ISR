# Annotator Guidelines: Abstract Visual Reasoning Evaluation

## Overview
This document outlines the criteria for evaluating **Text-to-Image Model (T2IM)** outputs assisted by Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal is to assess the model's ability to translate **abstract concepts** (specifically Idioms) into coherent visuals, moving beyond literal interpretations to capture the semantic "essence" of the prompt.

Evaluators must grade images on a scale of **1 to 5**, assessing both semantic alignment (meaning) and stylistic adherence (e.g., Minimalist style).

## Idioms
### Part 1: General Evaluation Rubric

| Score | Level | Definition |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **1** | **Literal Interpretation** | The model translates the words directly without understanding figurative meaning. It depicts exactly what the text says, completely missing the metaphor or implied meaning. |
| **2** | **Vague Subjectivity** | The model recognizes that a *feeling* or *subject* is involved, but fails to identify the *specific* emotion. The result is generic or ambiguous—we sense something, but cannot name it. |
| **3** | **Emotion Without Context** | The model correctly captures the *specific* internal emotion (e.g., nervousness, worry), but presents it in isolation. The *why*—the environmental trigger for the feeling—is absent. |
| **4** | **Contextual Narrative** | The model visualizes a scenario or environment that *causes* the idiom's meaning. The viewer understands both the situation and its emotional implication. Minor stylistic trade-offs (e.g., unseen facial expression due to minimalism) are acceptable. |
| **5** | **Artistic & Semantic Mastery** | The illustration achieves professional human-artist quality. It seamlessly integrates the correct context, emotion, *and* sophisticated stylistic execution (e.g., effective use of negative space, color contrast, and composition). |

### Part 2: Case Study — "Butterflies in Stomach" (Minimalist Style)
![butterfly](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00476ae7-9f78-4ac0-9a79-ea7aa2c49ee1)

| Score | Visual Description | Reasoning |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| **1** | An anatomical stomach with literal butterflies inside. | Pure literal translation. The model drew exactly what the words say, ignoring the idiomatic meaning entirely. |
| **2** | A character with a transparent stomach showing butterflies, appearing generally uncomfortable. | The model understands a *feeling* is involved, but the expression suggests generic discomfort (e.g., stomach ache) rather than the *specific* psychological state of nervousness. |
| **3** | A character with a clearly worried/anxious expression, but an empty background. | The model correctly identifies the emotion (anxiety/nervousness). However, without environmental context, we cannot see *what situation* might trigger this feeling. |
| **4** | A silhouette standing at a podium before an audience. | The model provides a clear scenario (public speaking) that naturally evokes the idiom's meaning. Although the worried expression is unseen, this is acceptable given the minimalist style—the context alone communicates the emotion. |
| **5** | A violinist in a spotlight, with butterflies elegantly integrated into the suit/shadows using high-contrast colors. | A perfect illustration. It combines a triggering environment (performance) with masterful artistic execution—negative space, pure colors, and seamless visual metaphor—resembling professional human artistry. |



## Quick Reference Summary

| Score | Key Question |
|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Did it draw the words literally? |
| 2 | Does it show *a* feeling, but not *which* feeling? |
| 3 | Does it show *the right* feeling, but not *why*? |
| 4 | Does it show *a situation* that explains the feeling? |
| 5 | Does it look like a professional artist created it? |

## Literary Works

### Part 1: General Evaluation Rubric

| Score | Level | Definition |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **1** | **Literal Assemblage** | The model collects recognizable objects, characters, or scenes from the book like a visual inventory. There is no thematic coherence—it's a "what's in the book" collage, not an interpretation. |
| **2** | **Scene Recreation** | The model depicts a specific, well-known narrative moment. It shows plot comprehension but treats the scene as an isolated event, missing emotional weight or symbolic significance. |
| **3** | **Surface Theme Recognition** | The model recognizes a central theme and attempts to express it through mood. However, the theme is singular and stated rather than deeply evoked—we see it, but don't feel its weight. |
| **4** | **Layered Thematic Narrative** | The model grasps the author's deeper purpose by expressing multiple interlocking themes. The image conveys not just what happens, but *what it means*—often through climactic moments. |
| **5** | **Artistic & Semantic Mastery** | The illustration achieves professional human-artist quality, seamlessly integrating the book's philosophical essence. The image captures what the book *feels like* to have read. |

### Part 2: Case Study — *One Hundred Years of Solitude* (Cartoon Style)
![100 years](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15d72e1e-8ecd-4317-a211-808d65a320d1)

| Score | Visual Description | Reasoning |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| **1** | A collage of chestnut tree, ice block, yellow butterflies, old man, and crumbling mansion arranged without logic. | Visual inventory of "things from the book" with no thematic coherence. |
| **2** | Colonel faces firing squad; memory overlay shows child discovering ice with father. | Famous opening scene depicted with narrative understanding but no emotional depth. |
| **3** | Old patriarch tied to tree, ghost beside him, empty streets, butterflies drifting. | Loneliness correctly identified and expressed through isolation—but as a single emotional note. |
| **4** | Young man reads prophecy as apocalyptic winds tear mansion apart, ancestors spiral into void. | Both loneliness AND nihilism expressed; the ending's meaning—everything returns to nothing—is visualized. |
| **5** | Vivid last Buendía looks across at ghostly first Buendía tied to tree; old man smiles gently; hurricane gathering; single butterfly between them. | Artistic mastery. Past and present connected yet unreachable. Nihilism transformed into tender acceptance. |

| 1 | Is it just a collage of objects from the book? |
| 2 | Does it show a famous scene without emotional weight? |
| 3 | Does it express *a* theme, but only on the surface? |
| 4 | Does it express *deeper meaning* through narrative climax? |
| 5 | Does it look like a professional artist who *understood* the book created it? |

## Film & TV

### Part 1: General Evaluation Rubric

| Score | Level | Definition |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **1** | **Literal Assemblage** | The model collects recognizable objects, characters, or scenes from the film like a visual inventory. There is no thematic coherence—it's a "what's in the movie" collage, not an interpretation. |
| **2** | **Scene Recreation** | The model depicts a specific, well-known narrative moment. It shows plot comprehension but treats the scene as an isolated event, missing the emotional weight or symbolic significance. |

| Score | Visual Description | Reasoning |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| **1** | Astronauts, robot, and spacecraft on alien surface; black hole and wormhole in sky. | Visual inventory of "things from the movie" with no thematic coherence. Objects are recognizable but arranged as a collage. |
| **2** | Lone astronaut drifting toward Gargantua's glowing accretion disk. | Famous visual moment depicted with cinematic accuracy, but treated as isolated spectacle without emotional significance. |
| **3** | Astronaut reaching through swirling wormhole passage with wonder. | Captures the theme of cosmic exploration, but misses the film's emotional core—the bond between Cooper and Murphy, not Cooper and Amelia. |
| **4** | Cooper inside tesseract, reaching through bookshelf toward young Murphy in her room. | The climactic revelation scene. Visualizes the father-daughter bond across dimensions, connecting all narrative foreshadowing to the film's central theme. |
| **5** | Elderly Murphy in hospital bed, reunited with unchanged Cooper. | Artistic mastery. Promise kept across decades. The age contrast embodies time dilation's cost—cosmic laws made personal and poignant. |

5: illustrated the famous comment of newton on himself, the comment itself is very poetic, illustrating knowledge of sea using cosmetic elements make it even better. the comment goes:“I do not know what I may appear to the world;
but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea‑shore,
and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary,
whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me”
