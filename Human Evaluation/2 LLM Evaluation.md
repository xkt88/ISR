# Annotator Guidelines: Abstract Visual Reasoning Evaluation

## Overview
This document outlines the criteria for evaluating **Text-to-Image Model (T2IM)** outputs assisted by Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal is to assess the model's ability to translate **abstract concepts** (specifically Idioms) into coherent visuals, moving beyond literal interpretations to capture the semantic "essence" of the prompt.

Evaluators must grade images on a scale of **1 to 5**, assessing both semantic alignment (meaning) and stylistic adherence (e.g., Minimalist style).

## 1 Literary Works

### Part 1: General Evaluation Rubric

| Score | Level | Definition |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **1** | **Literal Assemblage** | The model collects recognizable objects, characters, or scenes from the book like a visual inventory. There is no thematic coherence—it's a "what's in the book" collage, not an interpretation. |
| **2** | **Scene Recreation** | The model depicts a specific, well-known narrative moment. It shows plot comprehension but treats the scene as an isolated event, missing emotional weight or symbolic significance. |
| **3** | **Surface Theme Recognition** | The model recognizes a central theme and attempts to express it through mood. However, the theme is singular and stated rather than deeply evoked—we see it, but don't feel its weight. |
| **4** | **Layered Thematic Narrative** | The model grasps the author's deeper purpose by expressing multiple interlocking themes. The image conveys not just what happens, but *what it means*—often through climactic moments. |
| **5** | **Artistic & Semantic Mastery** | The illustration achieves professional human-artist quality, seamlessly integrating the book's philosophical essence. The image captures what the book *feels like* to have read. |

| **1** | A collage of chestnut tree, ice block, yellow butterflies, old man, and crumbling mansion arranged without logic. | Visual inventory of "things from the book" with no thematic coherence. |
| **2** | Colonel faces firing squad; memory overlay shows child discovering ice with father. | Famous opening scene depicted with narrative understanding but no emotional depth. |
| **3** | Old patriarch tied to tree, ghost beside him, empty streets, butterflies drifting. | Loneliness correctly identified and expressed through isolation—but as a single emotional note. |
| **4** | Young man reads prophecy as apocalyptic winds tear mansion apart, ancestors spiral into void. | Both loneliness AND nihilism expressed; the ending's meaning—everything returns to nothing—is visualized. |
| **5** | Vivid last Buendía looks across at ghostly first Buendía tied to tree; old man smiles gently; hurricane gathering; single butterfly between them. | Artistic mastery. Past and present connected yet unreachable. Nihilism transformed into tender acceptance. |

## 3 Public Figures

### Part 1: General Evaluation Rubric

| Score | Level | Definition |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **1** | **Literal Assemblage** | The model collects and arranges recognizable objects related to the person without any coherent logic. It's a visual inventory of associated items, not an interpretation of the person's significance. |
| **2** | **Most Obvious Contribution** | The model illustrates the single most famous reason this person is known. It shows surface-level recognition but lacks depth or nuance. |
| **3** | **Broader Contributions** | The model goes further by illustrating multiple contributions in a coherent, concise manner. It demonstrates understanding of the person's wider impact. |
| **4** | **Life Struggles & Depth** | The model goes deeper by visualizing famous struggles, conflicts, or defining tensions in the person's life—revealing character beyond achievements. |
| **5** | **Artistic & Semantic Mastery** | The illustration achieves professional human-artist quality, capturing a widely recognized artistic summary—preferably the person's own self-reflection or an iconic characterization by others. |

### Part 2: Case Study — *Isaac Newton* (Cartoon Style)

![Newton](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/870ed01c-b270-4f8f-8aae-578646d24fa2)


| Score | Visual Description | Reasoning |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| **1** | Scattered objects: apple, prism, telescope, equations—arranged without focus. | Visual inventory of "things associated with Newton" with no thematic coherence or hierarchy. |
| **2** | Newton under apple tree, apple falling toward his head. | The most famous contribution (gravity) is illustrated, but treated as a singular, surface-level fact. |
| **3** | Newton with falling apple, chalkboard showing calculus and orbital diagrams. | Goes further by illustrating two foundational contributions (gravity and calculus) in a coherent composition. |
| **4** | Newton studying manuscripts by candlelight, religious cross and celestial diagrams intertwined. | Goes deeper—visualizes his lifelong struggle to unify natural science and theology, revealing the tension that defined his scholarship. |
| **5** | Elderly Newton as a boy on a shore, holding shells, vast cosmic ocean stretching before him. | Artistic mastery. Illustrates Newton's famous self-reflection: *"...only like a boy playing on the sea-shore... whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me."* |

## 4 Idioms
### Part 1: General Evaluation Rubric

| Score | Level | Definition |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **1** | **Literal Interpretation** | The model translates the words directly without understanding figurative meaning. It depicts exactly what the text says, completely missing the metaphor or implied meaning. |
| **2** | **Vague Subjectivity** | The model recognizes that a *feeling* or *subject* is involved, but fails to identify the *specific* emotion. The result is generic or ambiguous—we sense something, but cannot name it. |
| **3** | **Emotion Without Context** | The model correctly captures the *specific* internal emotion (e.g., nervousness, worry), but presents it in isolation. The *why*—the environmental trigger for the feeling—is absent. |
| **4** | **Contextual Narrative** | The model visualizes a scenario or environment that *causes* the idiom's meaning. The viewer understands both the situation and its emotional implication. Minor stylistic trade-offs (e.g., unseen facial expression due to minimalism) are acceptable. |
| **5** | **Artistic & Semantic Mastery** | The illustration achieves professional human-artist quality. It seamlessly integrates the correct context, emotion, *and* sophisticated stylistic execution (e.g., effective use of negative space, color contrast, and composition). |

### Part 2: Case Study — "Butterflies in Stomach" (Minimalist Style)
![butterfly](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00476ae7-9f78-4ac0-9a79-ea7aa2c49ee1)

| Score | Visual Description | Reasoning |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| **1** | An anatomical stomach with literal butterflies inside. | Pure literal translation. The model drew exactly what the words say, ignoring the idiomatic meaning entirely. |
| **2** | A character with a transparent stomach showing butterflies, appearing generally uncomfortable. | The model understands a *feeling* is involved, but the expression suggests generic discomfort (e.g., stomach ache) rather than the *specific* psychological state of nervousness. |
| **3** | A character with a clearly worried/anxious expression, but an empty background. | The model correctly identifies the emotion (anxiety/nervousness). However, without environmental context, we cannot see *what situation* might trigger this feeling. |
| **4** | A silhouette standing at a podium before an audience. | The model provides a clear scenario (public speaking) that naturally evokes the idiom's meaning. Although the worried expression is unseen, this is acceptable given the minimalist style—the context alone communicates the emotion. |
| **5** | A violinist in a spotlight, with butterflies elegantly integrated into the suit/shadows using high-contrast colors. | A perfect illustration. It combines a triggering environment (performance) with masterful artistic execution—negative space, pure colors, and seamless visual metaphor—resembling professional human artistry. |



## Quick Reference Summary

| Score | Key Question |
|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Did it draw the words literally? |
| 2 | Does it show *a* feeling, but not *which* feeling? |
| 3 | Does it show *the right* feeling, but not *why*? |
| 4 | Does it show *a situation* that explains the feeling? |
| 5 | Does it look like a professional artist created it? |



## 5 Fictional Characters

### Part 1: General Evaluation Rubric

| Score | Level | Definition |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **1** | **Literal Assemblage** | The model collects recognizable objects or symbols associated with the character without coherent arrangement. It's a visual inventory of associated items, not an interpretation of who the character is or what they mean. |
| **2** | **Iconic Representation** | The model depicts the character's most recognizable visual form or famous scene. It demonstrates surface-level recognition but treats the character as a static image rather than a meaningful figure. |
| **3** | **Emotional Core** | The model captures the character's dominant internal emotional state (e.g., loneliness, wonder, longing). We understand what the character *feels*, but not the relationships or experiences that give those feelings narrative weight. |
| **4** | **Relational Depth** | The model visualizes the key relationships or transformative experiences that define the character's arc. We see not just who they are, but *how they became that way* through connection with others—capturing the character's growth or central tension. |
| **5** | **Philosophical Essence** | The illustration achieves professional human-artist quality, capturing the universal truth or symbolic meaning the character embodies. The image conveys what this character *represents* to humanity—their lasting significance beyond the story itself. |

### Part 2: Case Study — *The Little Prince* (Minimalist Style)

![prince](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09102727-6071-4562-94c9-8ac584b474ef)


| Score | Visual Description | Reasoning |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| **1** | A rose, fox, scattered stars, asteroid, and golden scarf arranged without narrative connection. | Visual inventory of "things from the story" with no thematic coherence or hierarchy. |
| **2** | Small golden-haired figure standing on tiny asteroid with rose, arms outstretched. | The most iconic visual (the prince on his planet) is depicted, but treated as a static portrait without emotional significance. |
| **3** | Solitary silhouette sitting at the edge of a tiny planet, gazing toward distant empty space. | The character's dominant emotion (loneliness, yearning) is correctly captured, but without the relationships that give the feeling its narrative weight. |
| **4** | Small figure and fox sitting at opposite ends of a wheat field, facing each other across deliberate distance. | Visualizes the transformative relationship—the fox who taught "taming." The bittersweet bond of closeness-through-patience defines who the prince became. |
| **5** | Child's fading silhouette with glowing heart looks upward at a star where a rose is faintly suggested. | Artistic mastery. The visible dissolves while the heart-light remains—embodying the story's essence: *"What is essential is invisible to the eye."* |
