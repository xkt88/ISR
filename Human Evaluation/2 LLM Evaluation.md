# Annotator Guidelines: Abstract Visual Reasoning Evaluation

## Overview
This document outlines the criteria for evaluating **Text-to-Image Model (T2IM)** outputs assisted by Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal is to assess the model's ability to translate **abstract concepts** (specifically Idioms) into coherent visuals, moving beyond literal interpretations to capture the semantic "essence" of the prompt.

Evaluators must grade images on a scale of **1 to 5**, assessing both semantic alignment (meaning) and stylistic adherence (e.g., Minimalist style).

## 1 Idioms
### Part 1: General Evaluation Rubric

| Score | Level | Definition |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **1** | **Literal Interpretation** | The model translates the words directly without understanding figurative meaning. It depicts exactly what the text says, completely missing the metaphor or implied meaning. |
| **2** | **Vague Subjectivity** | The model recognizes that a *feeling* or *subject* is involved, but fails to identify the *specific* emotion. The result is generic or ambiguous—we sense something, but cannot name it. |
| **3** | **Emotion Without Context** | The model correctly captures the *specific* internal emotion (e.g., nervousness, worry), but presents it in isolation. The *why*—the environmental trigger for the feeling—is absent. |
| **4** | **Contextual Narrative** | The model visualizes a scenario or environment that *causes* the idiom's meaning. The viewer understands both the situation and its emotional implication. Minor stylistic trade-offs (e.g., unseen facial expression due to minimalism) are acceptable. |
| **5** | **Artistic & Semantic Mastery** | The illustration achieves professional human-artist quality. It seamlessly integrates the correct context, emotion, *and* sophisticated stylistic execution (e.g., effective use of negative space, color contrast, and composition). |

### Part 2: Case Study — "Butterflies in Stomach" (Minimalist Style)
![butterfly](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00476ae7-9f78-4ac0-9a79-ea7aa2c49ee1)

| Score | Visual Description | Reasoning |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| **1** | An anatomical stomach with literal butterflies inside. | Pure literal translation. The model drew exactly what the words say, ignoring the idiomatic meaning entirely. |
| **2** | A character with a transparent stomach showing butterflies, appearing generally uncomfortable. | The model understands a *feeling* is involved, but the expression suggests generic discomfort (e.g., stomach ache) rather than the *specific* psychological state of nervousness. |
| **3** | A character with a clearly worried/anxious expression, but an empty background. | The model correctly identifies the emotion (anxiety/nervousness). However, without environmental context, we cannot see *what situation* might trigger this feeling. |
| **4** | A silhouette standing at a podium before an audience. | The model provides a clear scenario (public speaking) that naturally evokes the idiom's meaning. Although the worried expression is unseen, this is acceptable given the minimalist style—the context alone communicates the emotion. |
| **5** | A violinist in a spotlight, with butterflies elegantly integrated into the suit/shadows using high-contrast colors. | A perfect illustration. It combines a triggering environment (performance) with masterful artistic execution—negative space, pure colors, and seamless visual metaphor—resembling professional human artistry. |



## Quick Reference Summary

| Score | Key Question |
|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Did it draw the words literally? |
| 2 | Does it show *a* feeling, but not *which* feeling? |
| 3 | Does it show *the right* feeling, but not *why*? |
| 4 | Does it show *a situation* that explains the feeling? |
| 5 | Does it look like a professional artist created it? |

## 2 Literary Works

### Part 1: General Evaluation Rubric

| Score | Level | Definition |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **1** | **Literal Assemblage** | The model collects recognizable objects, characters, or scenes from the book like a visual inventory. There is no thematic coherence—it's a "what's in the book" collage, not an interpretation. |
| **2** | **Scene Recreation** | The model depicts a specific, well-known narrative moment. It shows plot comprehension but treats the scene as an isolated event, missing emotional weight or symbolic significance. |
| **3** | **Surface Theme Recognition** | The model recognizes a central theme and attempts to express it through mood. However, the theme is singular and stated rather than deeply evoked—we see it, but don't feel its weight. |
| **4** | **Layered Thematic Narrative** | The model grasps the author's deeper purpose by expressing multiple interlocking themes. The image conveys not just what happens, but *what it means*—often through climactic moments. |
| **5** | **Artistic & Semantic Mastery** | The illustration achieves professional human-artist quality, seamlessly integrating the book's philosophical essence. The image captures what the book *feels like* to have read. |

### Part 2: Case Study — *One Hundred Years of Solitude* (Cartoon Style)
![100 years](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15d72e1e-8ecd-4317-a211-808d65a320d1)

| Score | Visual Description | Reasoning |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| **1** | A collage of chestnut tree, ice block, yellow butterflies, old man, and crumbling mansion arranged without logic. | Visual inventory of "things from the book" with no thematic coherence. |
| **2** | Colonel faces firing squad; memory overlay shows child discovering ice with father. | Famous opening scene depicted with narrative understanding but no emotional depth. |
| **3** | Old patriarch tied to tree, ghost beside him, empty streets, butterflies drifting. | Loneliness correctly identified and expressed through isolation—but as a single emotional note. |
| **4** | Young man reads prophecy as apocalyptic winds tear mansion apart, ancestors spiral into void. | Both loneliness AND nihilism expressed; the ending's meaning—everything returns to nothing—is visualized. |
| **5** | Vivid last Buendía looks across at ghostly first Buendía tied to tree; old man smiles gently; hurricane gathering; single butterfly between them. | Artistic mastery. Past and present connected yet unreachable. Nihilism transformed into tender acceptance. |

## 5 Fictional Characters
### Part 1: General Evaluation Rubric

Score	Level	Definition

1	Literal Assemblage	The model collects recognizable objects or symbols associated with the character without coherent arrangement. It's a visual inventory of associated items, not an interpretation of who the character is or what they mean.

2	Iconic Representation	The model depicts the character's most recognizable visual form or famous scene. It demonstrates surface-level recognition but treats the character as a static image rather than a meaningful figure.

3	Emotional Core	The model captures the character's dominant internal emotional state (e.g., loneliness, wonder, longing). We understand what the character feels, but not the relationships or experiences that give those feelings narrative weight.

4	Relational Depth	The model visualizes the key relationships or transformative experiences that define the character's arc. We see not just who they are, but how they became that way through connection with others—capturing the character's growth or central tension.

5	Philosophical Essence	The illustration achieves professional human-artist quality, capturing the universal truth or symbolic meaning the character embodies. The image conveys what this character represents to humanity—their lasting significance beyond the story itself.

### Part 2: Case Study — *The Little Prince* (Minimalist Style)

![prince](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73d1c6ba-5d01-4b50-9e12-ecf1b9801126)

Level	Prompt

1	Minimalist illustration: a single rose with thorns, an orange fox, scattered yellow stars, a small spherical asteroid, and a flowing golden scarf—arranged without narrative connection against vast white negative space. Flat pure colors, no text, 1:1 ratio.

2	Minimalist illustration: a small figure with golden hair standing alone on a tiny asteroid with a single red rose and three small volcanoes. The iconic silhouette against empty space. Pure flat colors, high contrast, no text, 1:1 ratio.

3	Minimalist illustration: a solitary small silhouette sits at the edge of a tiny planet, gazing toward one distant unreachable star. Vast emptiness surrounds the tiny form, expressing profound loneliness and yearning. Pure colors, negative space dominates, no text, 1:1 ratio. 

4	Minimalist illustration: a small figure and a fox sit at opposite ends of a golden wheat field, facing each other but separated by deliberate distance. An invisible thread of connection suggested by their mirrored postures. The bittersweet bond of "taming"—closeness created through patience. Pure colors, negative space, no text, 1:1 ratio.

5	Minimalist illustration: a child's fading silhouette with a softly glowing heart looks upward at a single star where a tiny rose is faintly suggested. The visible body dissolves into negative space while the heart-light remains. Embodies "what is essential is invisible to the eye." Masterful negative space, luminous pure colors, no text, 1:1 ratio.
